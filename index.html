<b>Introduction</b>
</p>
</font>
<p>
Since many years our highly experienced innovative design and engineering group from Munich develops advanced open robotics platform. For experiments we were looking for affordable robot with powerful onboard processor; open, customisable and extensible hardware; and ability to send sensor data to cloud. Nothing on the market was cheaper than space shuttle!
</p><p>
We started to build our own but came across typical hardware, electronics and software challenges. One of the most important requirements we defined was to reduce the amount of components to simplify hardware building step.
</p><p>
We are using state of the art open hardware and software technologies. BeagleBoard as onboard computer provides great tradeoff between plenty of CPU performance and low power consumption for autonomous operations. 3D printed body makes customizations extremely easy. Real-time Linux extension allows precise motion control. ZeroC's Ice middleware supports cross-platform network communication with different programming languages. Custom developed adaptive video streaming keeps robot controllable over unpredictable Internet connection. After many iterations the platform reached maturity level ready for commercialisation.
</p><p>
For researchers in robotics, computer vision and AI domains this platform eliminates the need to solve hardware and base software problems. Instead, they can focus on advanced algorithms with ready to use base control and communication layer. In addition to low-level infrastructure we build advanced set of examples for localization, control and navigation. We also illustrate how to process real-time video stream on powerful cloud processing modules as well as onboard. 
</p><p>
Powered by recent developments in online education and growing interest in robotics, such as Stanford "Machine learning" course and Udacity's "Artificial Intelligence for Robotics", the demand on reasonably priced open robotics platform dramatically increased. In the next months we are going to bring the product to the market and looking for collaboration with experienced enterpreneurs to increase chances for success.

<b>Which needs does the project fulfill?</b>
</p>
</font>
<p>
Researchers starting in the fields of robotics, AI and computer vision usually spend considerable amount of time to build robotic vehicle to verify their software ideas. Using our platform, they can focus on actual research instead of solving standard mechanical and low-level control issues.

<b>Competitive advantages of our platform</b>
</p>
</font>
<p>
Comparing to existing and potential competitors our solution offers following advantages.
In the hardware area we provide:
<ul>
<li>Longer autonomous operation time with easy replaceable battery.</li>
<li>Significantly higher processing power with onboard ARM CPU and advanced TI DSP.</li>
<li>Easy customizable 3D-printed body for integration of additional sensors and actuators.</li>
<li>Simple electronic built out of standard high level components.</li>
<li>Wide range of out-of-the-box sensors.</li>
</ul>
In the software area we provide: 
<ul>
<li>Advanced communication infrastructure for cloud robotics.</li>
<li>Support for multiple programming languages.</li>
<li>Adaptive video streaming for remote operation over the Internet.</li>
<li>Set of examples for education scenarios.</li>
</ul>
By embracing open software and hardware paradigm we and our customers have access to vibrant and large community of developers and designers. By shifting complexity to the software and simplifying hardware we were able to reduce price to very competitive level.
